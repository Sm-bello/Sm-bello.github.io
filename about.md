# About Me

I am an aerospace engineering graduate with a focus on aircraft structural systems, digital twins,
and maintenance-oriented engineering design.

My work emphasizes connecting physics-based models with data and analytics to support
airworthiness, safety, and maintenance decision-making in aviation systems.
