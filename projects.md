# Projects

## Landing Gear Digital Twin

**Objective**  
To analyze landing gear structural response under varying touchdown velocities and fault scenarios.

**Approach**
- Physics-based modeling of landing dynamics
- Parameterized hard-landing scenarios
- Stress and deflection analysis

**Tools**
MATLAB, Simulink

## Virtual HUMS & CAMP System

**Objective**  
To design a virtual aircraft health monitoring and maintenance analytics system using simulated data.

**System Architecture**
- Telegraf for data ingestion
- InfluxDB for high-frequency time-series data
- PostgreSQL for events, configurations, and maintenance records
- Grafana dashboards for visualization and decision support

**Focus**
Architecture, data flow, and maintenance logic rather than physical sensor hardware.
